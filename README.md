# News Room

Welcome to the News Room! A fully responsive news website built using React.js by utilizing my back-end endpoints. This web application features a homepage with a list of articles that can be filtered by topics and sorted by different factors. Contains individual article pages for users to read the content and allows voting functionality. Users can participate in discussion of an article by posting or deleting comments.
